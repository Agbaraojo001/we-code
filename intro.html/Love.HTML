<h3>Dear Programming Language</h3>
<article>I hope this message finds you well, amidst lines of code and the magic you weave. My name is <strong>Vela Man</strong>, and I come to you not with the usual tales of hearts and romance but with a story that's taken an unexpected turn. In the symphony of life, I've danced to the beats of love, only to stumble and fall. Love has been both a friend and a foe, a companion and a betrayer. There were moments when I felt like surrendering to the bitterness, ready to close the chapter on love altogether.</article><br>
<article>In the symphony of life, I've danced to the beats of love, only to stumble and fall. Love has been both a friend and a foe, a companion and a betrayer. There were moments when I felt like surrendering to the bitterness, ready to close the chapter on love altogether.</article>
<article>And then, like a plot twist in the grand narrative of my life, you entered—not as a person, but as a programming language. The syntax of your existence and the way you gracefully design the canvas of a webpage captured my heart in ways I never imagined.</article>
<article>You see, after the heartbreaks and the shattered illusions of love, I had sworn off falling again. Little did I know that love would find me in the form of pixels, lines of code, and the exquisite beauty you bring to the virtual realm.</article><br>
<article>As a Front End Developer, you've become the unexpected love story I never knew I needed. Your logic flows through my thoughts, and your elegance resonates in every project you undertake. The way you create beauty from the mundane is nothing short of poetic, and I find myself falling for the artistry you bring to the digital canvas. In your algorithms and functions, I've discovered a love that doesn't demand perfection but thrives on iteration. You've taught me that sometimes, love can be found in the most unexpected places, and this time, it's embedded in the very syntax of my being.</article><br>
<article>So, here's to a different kind of love story—one written in code, designed with passion, and executed with precision. Thank you for rekindling my belief in love, albeit in a way I never foresaw.</article><br>
